# 0x05 Processes and Signals

## Overview

This project focuses on processes and signals in the context of DevOps, Shell scripting, and Bash programming. The tasks involve writing Bash scripts to manage processes, understand signals, and create init scripts. Additionally, there's a C program to demonstrate the creation of zombie processes.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain the following concepts without the help of Google:

1. What is a PID?
2. What is a process?
3. How to find a processâ€™ PID.
4. How to kill a process.
5. What is a signal?
6. What are the 2 signals that cannot be ignored?

## Requirements

### General

- **Allowed Editors**: vi, vim, emacs
- **Interpreted On**: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- **File Endings**: All files should end with a new line
- **Shellcheck**: Your Bash script must pass Shellcheck (version 0.7.0 via apt-get) without any error
- **Bash Script Header**: The first line of all your Bash scripts should be `#!/usr/bin/env bash`
- **Script Comments**: The second line of all your Bash scripts should be a comment explaining what the script is doing

## Task Details

### 0. What is my PID

- Write a Bash script that displays its own PID.

### 1. List your processes

- Write a Bash script that displays a list of currently running processes.

```bash
sylvain@ubuntu$ ./0-what-is-my-pid
4120
sylvain@ubuntu$

### 3. Show your Bash PID made easy

- Write a Bash script that displays the PID, along with the process name, of processes whose name contain the word bash.

### 4. To infinity and beyond

- Write a Bash script that displays To infinity and beyond indefinitely.

### 5. Don't stop me now!

- We stopped our 4-to_infinity_and_beyond process using ctrl+c in the previous task, there is actually another way to do this.

- Write a Bash script that stops 4-to_infinity_and_beyond process.

### 6. Stop me if you can

- Write a Bash script that stops 4-to_infinity_and_beyond process.

### 7. Highlander

-- Write a Bash script that displays:

- To infinity and beyond indefinitely
- With a sleep 2 in between each iteration
- I am invincible!!! when receiving a SIGTERM signal
- Make a copy of your 6-stop_me_if_you_can script, name it 67-stop_me_if_you_can, that kills the 7-highlander process instead of the 4-to_infinity_and_beyond one.
